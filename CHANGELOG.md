## 3.0.0

Remove mixin in favor of HOC.

## 2.1.1

* make 'keybindingsOnInputs' opt-in, the default is again that inputs do not trigger keybindings

## 2.1.0

* allow keybinding while focused on an input via keybindingsOnInputs
* extend support for React 0.14
* remove dependency on react to peerDependencies

## 2.0.1

* Fix `formatCode` with shifted keys: they now display as the input, like +,
  rather than the required keys, like shift+=

## 1.2.0

* Implement keybinding formatter that simplifies and shortens longform
  keycodes for display in interfaces.

## 1.1.1

* Never push `undefined` onto the array of keybindings. This is useful
  if you have a component that reads keybindings but doesn't have any of its own.
